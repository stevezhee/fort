- make builds faster
- there must be a faster way to do installs
- pretty print Haskell code (both written and generated)
- add haddock
- test out more complicated nested ifs/arrays/records (which I stupidly named the test file struct.fort)
- string buffers
- create a stack datatype which is a record with an Int for the `top` and an array of the data
- initialization of constructed datatypes (i.e. records, arrays, variants (once I get them working))
- make error reporting better
- add sizes to array indices
- add an easy mechanism to write tests
- add constraints for ad-hoc polymophism
- n-dimensional tuples
- polymorphic containers (arrays, tuples, variants, records)
- make bools a variant type
- generate convience functions for variant `/case`s
- create `volatile` type builtin
- unary operators

done:
- add hex, octal, and binary literals
- get dependencies in makefile correct
- generate output functions for each datatype
- added user defined externals
- get up to date on latest llvm-hs
- add all the llvm arithmetic operators
- add the llvm `bitcast` operator and some of the other non-arithmetic ones
- add constraints to the arithmetic operators so that they are (constrained) polymorphic
- add a primitive to put/get a character from a handle (and add stdin/stdout/stderr values)
- multi-dimensional arrays (this one might be a big tougher)
- add sizes to Arrays
- make chars their own types
- constant strings
- use type families instead of functional dependencies?
- investigate using llvm-hs-typed
- added make target for pretty printing and have hlint running in emacs
