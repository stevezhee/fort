- get dependencies in makefile correct
- make builds faster
- pretty print Haskell code (both written and generated)
- add git hooks for pretty printing and hlint
- add haddock
- add a primitive to put/get a character from a handle (and add stdin/stdout/stderr values)
- test out more complicated nested ifs/arrays/records (which I stupidly named the test file struct.fort)
- multi-dimensional arrays (this one might be a big tougher)
- add all the llvm arithmetic operators
- add constraints to the arithmetic operators so that they are (constrained) polymorphic
- strings and string buffers
- create a stack datatype which is a record with an Int for the `top` and an array of the data
- initialization of constructed datatypes (i.e. records, arrays, variants (once I get them working))
- add the llvm `bitcast` operator and some of the other non-arithmetic ones
- add sizes to Arrays
- investigate using llvm-hs-typed
